# hello-world
This the in-depth practice repository.
I am Jacqueline Keeton.  I am excited about my new journey in software development as I continue to hone skills as a full stack web developer.  I have had my toe in the water for the past 25 years working with school websites and online calendars as webmaster.  I later recieved my masters degree in instructional technology.  I have been able to use those acquired skills working with faculty, staff, students, and parents since 2005.
